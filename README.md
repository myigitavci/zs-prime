**ZS-PRIME: Zero-Shot Self-Supervised Distortion-Free Diffusion MRI Reconstruction**

Multi-Shot Distortion-Free Diffusion-Weighted MRI Reconstruction with Zero-Shot Self-Supervised Learning

Welcome to the official repository for ZS-PRIME, a novel framework for zero-shot self-supervised diffusion MRI reconstruction that operates directly on undersampled k-space. 

For training, run:
python zsprime_all_directions_all_slices.py

and for inference, run: 

python zsprime_all_directions_all_slices_inference.py
